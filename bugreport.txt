Bug Reports
-----------
These are the requirements for posting bugs, any bug report that does not follow these rules will be handled only AFTER all other bug reports are filed.
Use of the form given at the end is optional, but prefered as it means it is simpler for me to track down bugs.

Please also remember, the addon works 100% for me, otherwise I would not have released it.
If you see something, it is because of something that you do differently from me, either running different addons,
or even visiting the battlegrounds (I PvP only in defense at this time).
Also note that the following rules are in place to cut-down on the user arguements in the forums.
I won't discuss these rules, nor will I discuss the way I handle each rule item.
The various forums I use as a method for users who wish to improve my addons to contact me with their suggestions, and their likes/dislikes.

ALL bug reports MUST contain the following information:-
1) The EXACT error message from World of Warcraft.
2) What you where doing that caused the error to occour.
3) If you are using the supplied data, or if you are learning the flight paths yourself.


Before reporting any bugs make sure of the following:-
1) It is an actual error, with a blizzard supplied error message.
   Without that, the issue is either due a conflict with another addon (such as graphics glitches), or it is a feature not working the way you expect.
   Both of these should be reported so I can see if I can figure out why, or explain why the feature works the way it does.

2) You are running the latest version of the addon.
   If you have a version even one release old, I may have fixed your bug already, please read the release notes to see if it is listed,
   if not please upgrade but still file the bug report providing also the information that you are running an earlier release, and give me the version number so I can track down the bug.

3) If you run other addons, I need to be sure it is _my_ addon that is causing the issue.
   If it is something that happens often (as in you can easily repeat it), please disable all other addons and see if it still occours,
   if so, then it is definately my addon doing something strange.  If not, then enable the addons you have until you see it re-occour.
   Once you have found the other addon(s) that cause the problem, please tell me that information in your bug report.
   Telling me you have a huge pile of addons so can't validate it is my addon specifically, will just result in me placing your message in my trash folder,
   as I will assume you have no interest in seeing this addon working as it should.
   If you are using this addon, and do not know how to enable/disable addons, then I recommend reading the World of Warcraft user manual before using any further addons.

4) Issues related to using this addon with other addon packs/suites (for example, Cosmos), or using this addon when other libraries are installed,
   will only be corrected by me if the code is definately my addon that is causing the problem.
   I cannot be responsible for fixing the other addon(s), and I will not write code that kicks in only if another addon is installed,
   unless I am already supporting that addon.  For example, addons (of mine) with a GUI options screen that have errors with myAddons will be fixed,
   as I support the use of that with those addons.  On the other hand errors caused by sea will not be corrected as I do not support the use of sea with any addon.
   If an addon library/suite brings out a valid error with my code, I will correct my code to work as it was intended, I will consider each report on a case-by-case basis however.


Please cut and paste the sections between the "Bug Report Form" lines into your bug report.  Fill in all possible information.
