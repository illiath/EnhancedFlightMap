FanUpdate by beren12


2019-09-23  Version 3.1.0-Classic
---------------------------------
- Fix issue #5 on github, druid flightpaths now tracks and is configured.


2019-09-23  Version 3.1.0-Classic
---------------------------------
- Fix issue #3 on github, zone map flight points not showing as known/unknown.
- Add enhancement, per issue #4 on github, add flight node markers to the world map.
- Initial preload data import, much of the information is currently missing in the dataset, but hey at least there's something now...


2019-09-20  Version 3.0.0-Classic
---------------------------------
- Update EFM to work with WoW Classic.


2012-10-23  Version 2.2.8
-------------------------
- Make new offline map window closable with the escape key (Google Code Issue# 19).



2012-10-22  Version 2.2.7
-------------------------
- Added code to fix issue where code was assuming a flight node a specific location could only occur in one continent, now we validate continent on node lookup.
- Code cleanup, remove commented code blocks that where legacy for bug fixes, and add some missing comments, still more need adding.
- Re-added function to delete all data related to a node.


2012-10-19  Version 2.2.6
-------------------------
- Fix errors in FrameXML Log (Binding Header).
- Add support for Pandaria to "offline" window.
- Remove old configuration screen code.
- Imported new code from Google Code issue #17.
- Program-generated "offline" map window.


2012-09-09  Version 2.2.5
-------------------------
- Update .toc for 5.0.4


2011-08-12  Version 2.2.4
-------------------------
- Add flight node "hide" button to world map, solves google code issue# 13.
- Codebase fixes for water "flight" nodes, thanks to goahead.hansen via google code site.  Still need to add support to display nodes, but data collection now working as intended.
- Google Code Issue #12 fixed.
- Imported new Alliance node data (Google Code issue #6, and half of #9).


2011-07-23  Version 2.2.3
-------------------------
- Another code cleanup and work on doing water and land flight nodes differently.
- Expect I need to do a complete code rewrite soon.


2011-01-13  Version 2.2.2
-------------------------
- Rewrote code that adds flight nodes to the database.  The new code requires user to visit each flight node before it adds it, and it adds them into the current zone.
- Larger EFM flight display window (Google Code issue #11).
- Correct route line display issue that crops up while generating new data sets.
- Added water-node handling, this code won't clean up h0rked flight nodes, so manual cleanup (or complete node data wipe) will be needed for this.


2010-10-12  Version 2.2.1
-------------------------
- Fixes for WoW 4.0.
- Initial version of new config screen, will need to import as appropriate shortly.


2010-01-17  Version 2.2.0a
--------------------------
- The release is for another (hopefully better) fix for some of the other flight node "fixes" implemented previously.  This is the initial alpha of this fix, so it'll need a lot more work.
- Fix for google code issue#5 PTR not instantiating variables correctly, code check to validate that EFM_Data exists in one core module.


2009-03-22  Version 2.1.2
-------------------------
- Fix EFM config setup, if you previously had a timer size set it should not reset the size.
- Fix for "phantom" or "moving" flight nodes, this issue is where flight node data corrupts your EFM savedvariables due to Blizzard using different names for the zone the node in in the flight master window from where the real zone is in.  This doesn't "magically" catch those nodes and put them in the right place, but it does stop the phantom nodes from appearing in another zones.  The real node still needs to be added to the EFM_SearchZones fixup array in the your locale's localization file.
- Updated localization files for deDE and enUS for above issue.
- Random minor code cleanup in flight master code, was needed to discover cause of the "phantom" node issue.
- Fix for issue display flight nodes on the EFM Map Window on the PTR.
- Reverse DK "hack".
- Implement correct fix for DK flight path issues.  This fix should also clean up invalid data, however some flight data could have already been corrupted, and cannot be fixed automatically.


2009-01-01  Version 2.1.1
-------------------------
- "Fix" for DK flight path information... Flight points not valid for your faction should no longer show on the EFM version of the map windows.
- Hack to Argent Vanguard flight point for horde, needs to be tested alliance side, but at this time, appears functional.


2008-11-30  Version 2.1.0
-------------------------
- More minor code cleanup.
- Fixed the "Fixup" routine to correctly erase invalid flight nodes.


2008-11-27  Version 2.0.10
--------------------------
- Code refactoring of the config and map screens.  More work still needed.
- Added additional missing Fixups for new Northrend flight nodes.  Only enUS/enGB and deDE confirmed fully working with these fixups, data missing for ruRU and frFr.
- Cleanup of Config and Map screens.
- Minor change to the Fixup code.
- Added Northrend to the Map screen.
- General code-cleanup and minor fixes throughout code, more work is expected over the next few days.


2008-10-24  Version 2.0.9
-------------------------
- Added ruRU locale, thanks to "Паладкобальт" on realm  "Ясеневый лес" (thank goodness my machine understands UTF-8 *grin*).
- Added scaling to in-flight timer bar, thanks to Gollath on realm Taerar (de).
- Also updates to deDE locale, again thanks to Gollath.


2008-09-20  Version 2.0.8
-------------------------
- Updates for 3.0
- Fixed button text


2008-04-20  Version 2.0.7
-------------------------
- Corrected bug with config screen.
- Corrected in-game version numbers.


2007-10-16  Version 2.0.6
-------------------------
- Correct button level on world map.  Icon no longer is "higher" than the tooltip.
- Add option to set flight times to calculated when the time difference is greater than 30 seconds.   Before this was automatic at 2 minutes.
- Update .toc version.

-------------------------
- Update .toc version.

2007-09-02  Version 2.0.4
-------------------------
- Minor improvements to the flight node markers on the world map (Should be easier to select them to see details now).


2007-09-01  Version 2.0.3
-------------------------
- Update .toc version.
- Update flight data (minor time and path improvements).


2007-04-03  Version 2.0.2
-------------------------

- Add keybindings for reporting to party/raid/guild.


2007-03-13  Version 2.0.1
-------------------------
- Update tooltip code to calculate tooltip scale rather than setting it's parent due to tooltip issues.


2007-03-08  Version 2.0
-----------------------
- Beta tested and no reports filed for over a week, beta now stable and called live.
- Added in additional Horde data.
- Provided data for Alliance still has major holes, collection will occur as time and interest permits, though any data given will be imported for the next release.
- Added new flight status window, this should allow for easier movement of the flight status window.
- New status bar can be selected to grow or shrink to reflect time remaining.
- Update configuration frame to reflect new options.
- Link the EFM tooltip to the UIParent, this means global UI scaling will affect the EFM tooltip as well.
- German and French clients, the standard (as in non Burning Crusade) areas should work flawlessly, however there is a known issue with the Silvermoon City flight master.
- Localization for languages other than English need overhauling.  Also the exact names as given by blizzard for the zones of Eversong Woods and Silvermoon City are needed for each non-English locale.
- Also there is NO data for any locale other than enUS and enGB.  Please send me data if you use EFM and you are in a different locale.


2007-02-22  Version 2.0b10
--------------------------
- Add back in zone recognition strings for deDE and frFR locales.  Information still missing for Silvermoon City/Eversong Woods.
- Zone name matching is now done in lowercase, this should fix the deDE zone matching issue.


2007-02-13  Version 2.0b9
-------------------------
- Fix issue with AddRoutes function.


2007-02-12  Version 2.0b8
-------------------------
- Remove debug messages for Fixup code.
- Shorten missing flight route display message.
- Fix bug where flight routes would be erased or reduced if the flight master was visited by a different character that did not know of the flight route.

- Additional data added to the preloaded enUS/enGB data set.


2007-02-05  Version 2.0b7
-------------------------
- Fix remote display issue with known routes displaying in incorrect colours.
- Modify tooltip reference, perhaps this will fix the reported (but unable to be validated) issue with the tooltip not showing up for some users all the time.


2007-02-04  Version 2.0b6
-------------------------
- Fix EFM_Data_NodeFixup code fubar.
- Fix issue with flight node tooltips on remote map if flight node has not actually been visited.


2007-02-03  Version 2.0b5
-------------------------
- Update flight node zone location marker position for Silvermoon City, unfortunately this does need localization :-(.
- Fix the "/efm report" code.
- Add flight routes to the efm remote map tooltip, the remote map tooltips and the zone/world map tooltips are now identical.


2007-02-01  Version 2.0b4
-------------------------
- Update precision for continent map locations, minor cosmetic fix to allow for data sharing improvements.


2007-02-01  Version 2.0b3
-------------------------
- Fixed issue where taking a "special" flight (such as an outland bombing run) would use the destination of a previous flight path.
- Cleanup of globals.lua removing unused variables.
- Cleanup of localization files removing unused strings.
- Re-enabled the "unknown flight times" special feature.  Uses the same variable defined in globals.lua as before.
- enGB and enUS use the same flight data so the import code reflects this.  Any other matchups like this just notify me of them and I'll do it.


2007-01-31  Version 2.0b2
-------------------------
- Fix multi-hop flight time issue where unknown flight times for entire route could be used as the actual flight time.
- Update flight master map location precision.
- Data clearing routines re-written and re-implemented.  It is now possible to clear single faction or all data.
- Data load routines re-written and re-implemented.  Currently the only provided data is for the enUS locale.


2007-01-28  Version 2.0b1
-------------------------
- Update flight timer averaging code to handle whole numbers only.
- Correct issue with /efm config not working.


2007-01-22  Version 2.0a5
-------------------------
- Background of config screen sections darkened.
- Disable extra timer bar options when timer is disabled.


2007-01-22  Version 2.0a4
-------------------------
- Rewrite remote map window.

2007-01-17  Version 2.0a2
-------------------------
- Fix for multiple flight nodes showing up in the available routes display.
- Fix for displaying data for nodes you don't (yet) know the location of.


2007-01-17  Version 2.0a1
-------------------------
- Major EFM code rewrite to handle blizzard breaking the LUA saved variables concept.
- EFM data is now locale-specific, therefore data cannot be shared between locales.


2006-12-28  Version 1.6.1
-------------------------
- Fix display issue with EFM config screen.
- Fix loading error when data is clear.


2006-12-28  Version 1.6
-----------------------
- Beta test phase over, so far a week with no bug reports, so 1.6 is now live.
- Add some data for Alliance for BC, data supplied from BC closed beta realm, so may not be valid for BC live.
- Add option to "overlay" flight map onto continent map...
- Cleanup of node checking code, split into seperate function for reliability and future improvements.
- Move EFM statusbar away from the toplevel, this should allow it to hide under other windows while in flight.
- Flight Master zone/continent markers now display flight nodes alphabetically sorted.
- Updates to the handling of the zone map display code, the new code should be more robust than the old code.


2006-12-14  Version 1.6b5
-------------------------
- Add German language updates.  This should hopefully provide deDE support.


2006-12-08  Version 1.6b4
-------------------------
- Special flight node naming for BC fix implemented.
- Add additional non-BC Alliance data - data appears to have been lost in beta 3 for Kalimdor.


2006-12-03  Version 1.6b3
-------------------------
- Remote flight display and configuration screen are now closable with the escape key.
- If the Blizzard TaxiFrame or Blizzard GossipFrame are open, the EFM remote display frame will be shown to it's right.
- Split Remote Taxi Frame functions to a seperate file from the Blizzard taxi frame data collection routines.
- Horde data is complete for the non-expansion content.
- Alliance data is complete for the non-expansion content.
- Data for the expansion still needed.
- Translations still needed.
- Silithus now referenced by a global variable so the Blizzard multi-flight-path data bug can be caught even if zone numbers change (again).


2006-11-24  Version 1.6b2
-------------------------
- Update continent reference checks to use a global variable for the maximum continent number.
- Update remote flight map display code to not reuse blizzard code for it's display, this means blizzard can do what they want to their flight map and it won't break the remote display functions.
- Gather some basic data for the preload sets.


2006-11-15  Version 1.6b1
-------------------------
- *NOTE* Due to the major land form changes with 2.0, all previous data is no longer viable, and will be deleted upon addon load.
- Update .toc for 2.0
- Update for loops for LUA 5.1 (backwards compatible to 5.0)
- Update hooking routines
- Update i18n file for new zone and continent numbering
- Update timer and routing data collection to handle lua 5.1 compliance.


2006-10-03  Version 1.5.1
-------------------------
- Update route validation routines to hide nodes from the other faction.
- Make sure where GetCurrentMapZone() is used that SetMapToCurrentZone() is used first.
- Modify status bar frame to use own status bar, and not the Blizzard CastingBarFrame, this makes the bar movable by EFM once more.
- Modify EFM_FM_TaxiNodeOnButtonEnter function to only update the tooltip, but let all other work be done by Blizzard.
- Add routine to clear up data that might cause EFM errors from issues fixed above.
- Duplicate flight entries should no longer display in world map tooltips.


2006-08-29  Version 1.5
-----------------------
- Official release of 1.5.
- Still missing french translations for new text, but this can be updated later.
- .toc is matched to 1.12.


2006-08-17  Version 1.5b7
-------------------------
- Update to deDE locale details for Un'Goro Crater.
- Generic updates to deDE locale file.  Many thanks to those have supplied the necessary updates.
- Increase the allowed time difference between calculate time and recorded time, as some flight paths just seem to run a little strange...


2006-08-16  Version 1.5b6
-------------------------
- Correct issues the /efm clear all command, this new implementation should speed up processing time in various situations and also remove all bugs I saw of the other methods.


2006-08-14  Version 1.5b5
-------------------------
- Fix empty data set bug relating to data updating for the alliance moonglade flight node.
- Add function to load times for known flights only.  Current incarnation only adds single-hop flight data.
- Update configuration screen to toggle loading of known flight times or all data.


2006-08-14  Version 1.5b4b
--------------------------
- Quickie Fix for Crash when displaying remote flight map after talking to a flight master, this fix is only needed for 1.11, but it is programatically more correct, so it's staying :-)


2006-08-14  Version 1.5b4
-------------------------
- Remove Debug line from remote display.
- Fix Alliance Druid flight point display.
- Add function to move flight nodes around, this function will be called by EFM programatically in future versions as Blizzard moves flightpaths around.
- The above routine allows for moving of old Alliance Moonglade flight path to new location, this will update all references to the old flightnode to point to the new flightnode, and delete any duplicate entries.
- Update to flightpath data.


2006-08-13  Version 1.5b3
-------------------------
- Fix issue with remote flight display.  Blizzard modified the return value of certain functions and so the new method will result in extra processing due to this.
- Fix CastingBarFrame resize issue.
- Fix issue when attempting to display the remote flight display when in an instance, if no continent to display is given.
- Modify line and node drawing routines to line up with 1.12 styling, this makes the load-time memory usage a little less, and also means the node numbers and flight line numbers are no longer static.


2006-08-09  Version 1.5b2
-------------------------
- Update flightpath handling for druid flight paths.  System now hooks the gossip functions to figure out when flying from moonglade.  Currently all locales will have the druid flightpath listed as "Nighthaven, Moonglade".
- /efm clear all now clears ALL saved EFM data.  This includes known paths for the character as well as any settings the character has set.  This returns all EFM global data to defaults as EFM will have errors if it is attempted to be used after a complete clear.
- Added additional flight data, hopefully the preloaded data set now includes a complete 1.11 for Horde, and a complete 1.11 for Alliance (the latter is untested).


2006-08-08  Version 1.5b1
-------------------------
- Calculated flight time only displays if it is a multi-hop flight.
- Modify calc/recorded settings so that if the calculated flight time is more than 30 seconds different than recorded time replace the recorded flight time with the calculated time.
- If there are missing single-hop flights in a multi-hop flight path it will display a * beside the calculated flight time and not record the flight time.
- Fix nodeinfo file bug.
- Add keybindings for map display options.
- Remote map display now lists the name of the continent.
- Modify status bar display to attach text to the top of the standard casting bar, this means that I no longer need to care where the castingbarframe resides anymore, this also means it is unmovable from it's default location by EFM...
- Updates to German Locale in i18n.lua.


2006-06-22  Version 1.4.7
-------------------------
- Added a calculated duration line to the flight display.  Also use the calculated value if flying a multi-hop route of unknown time.
- Updated toc for 1.11


2006-05-08  Version 1.4.6
-------------------------
- Correct map line 91 error for non-enUS clients.

- Add additional flight time data for horde to the preload data set.
- Update zone not found handling to be a little clearer.
- Update i18n zone matching to be a "plain" match and not accept magic characters.


2006-04-18  Version 1.4.3
-------------------------
- Modify event registration/unregistration to not even bother dealing with events between the PLAYER_LEAVING_WORLD and PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD events.
- Add timer hide to the PLAYER_LEAVING_WORLD event, this should catch any timers hanging around when you get portalled out while in flight.
- Modify EFM_FN_GetNodeByName function to look for bad data, and ignore if data bad.
- Additional changes to i18n coding.


2006-04-10  Version 1.4.2
-------------------------
- Fix error on login caused by misentered entry for missing zone mapping error message.
- Fix error at Flightmaster caused by the EFM_FN_GetNodeByName function.
- Minor code complexity reduction in the i18n code.


2006-04-10  Version 1.4.1
-------------------------
- Modify locale code to reference zone data from my own reference map, this should solve the zone name->number issue.
- Flight nodes that cannot be matched to known data will display an error message in the chat window to be reported for inclusion in the zone mapping table.
- Locale table converted to UTF-8 Decimal version strings.
- Add extra alliance data.


2006-04-04  Version 1.4
-----------------------
- Official 1.4 release
- Fix line clearing bug, blizzard flight lines where not previously being cleared from the efm remote display screen


2006-04-01  Version 1.4 Beta 11
-------------------------------
- BETA RELEASE FOR WOW 1.10 RELEASE.
- Add option to clear data for a single faction, this way users can erase a faulty horde/alliance data set and not lose any data from the other faction.  Mostly added for testing, but I'm sure some will find this handy.
- Add hidden data precision conversion routine - this should only be used as directed by myself, or automatically used for those who have run a beta version of EFM 1.4 before.
- Data precisions are now defined globally, this allows users who need less precision in the map collection to adjust automatically.
- Hack CastingBarFrame modification routines to handle some CT_MasterMod weirdness, the progress bar location will not be movable, it will be stuck where the CT_Mod team has decided to place it.
- Fix bug with druid flight path showing when option disabled, and being hidden when enabled.
- Add additional Horde flight path data.
- Alliance data cleanup, data was being duplicated, this has been fixed.


2006-03-30  Version 1.4 Beta 10
-------------------------------
- BETA RELEASE FOR WOW 1.10 RELEASE.
- Modify CastingBarFrame data collection settings.
- Fix flightpath collection for Nighthave, Moonglade, same issue as with Silithus.
- Fix map data collection for Orgrimmar.
- Add some additional Horde and Alliance data.


2006-03-28  Version 1.4 Beta 9
------------------------------
- BETA RELEASE FOR WOW 1.10 RELEASE.
- Correct issue with CastingBarFrame disappearing after taking a flight.
- Clean up remaining Lys_Library function call.


2006-03-28  Version 1.4 Beta 8
------------------------------
- BETA RELEASE FOR WOW 1.10 RELEASE.
- Correct data load bug.
- Move timer init into main init routine.
- Move init routines to ADDON_LOADED event handler.


2006-03-28  Version 1.4 Beta 7
------------------------------
- BETA RELEASE FOR WOW 1.10 RELEASE.
- Correct colour code bug.  This bug was due to removing the pre-dependance upon Lys_Library (Which will soon go out of development, and has not been updated for 1.10 anyhow).


2006-03-28  Version 1.4 Beta 6
------------------------------
- BETA RELEASE FOR WOW 1.10 RELEASE.
- Fix configuration import bug.


2006-03-23  Version 1.4 Beta 5
------------------------------
- BETA RELEASE FOR WOW 1.10 RELEASE.
- Remove all but the basic command line options.  All config is now handled via the GUI menu.
- Clean up of unused display strings.
- Update so the changes Blizzard made to test realm do not break the remote report screen.
- Shared functions have been cleaned up (unused functions removed) and addon no longer depends (even suggested) upon Lys_Library which is soon do be removed.
- In-flight timer bar is now built using the blizzard CastingBarFrame.  I can think of no time while in flight the CastingBarFrame will be possible to get used while in flight, hence the change.
- Added tooltips to the configuration screen.
- Added an option to shift the in-flight display up or down on the screen.
- Updated frFR and deDE locale files.  These files now match lines almost exactly with the english locale file, lines not translated have been commented out but left in the files.
- Update to flight averaging code.  If flight time difference is more than 10 seconds we reset to the new time.  Either Blizzard updated the flight time, or else this is a multi-hop route and we went a different way this time.


2006-03-14  Version 1.4 Beta 4
------------------------------
- BETA RELEASE FOR WOW 1.10 RELEASE.
- Add flight time averaging.  Each repeat flight time calculation for a flight point will be averaged against the previous time if it's length is within 10 seconds of a previous flight along this route.


2006-03-13  Version 1.4 Beta 3
------------------------------
- BETA RELEASE FOR WOW 1.10 RELEASE.
- Taxi Data is now referenced in a locale-independant manner.  All previous data will need to be erased to handle the change.
- Taxi Data is now much more accessible for other functions due to the various routines created to access that data.
- Major overhaul to taxi data structure.  This should store the flight data in a language-independant system, meaning everyone who runs this addon should be able to share the data pool, rather than needing seperate data sets as before.


2006-03-10  Version 1.4 Beta 2
------------------------------
- BETA RELEASE FOR WOW 1.10 RELEASE.
- Update remote map display to use blizzard's new line draw function.

------------------------------
- BETA RELEASE FOR WOW 1.10 RELEASE.
- Many changes to support WoW 1.10.

- Add option to choose a specific continent when showing map screen. /efm open kalimdor for kalimdor, and /efm open azeroth for azeroth/eastern kingdoms.
- Issue with display of blizzard flight node data... might need a rebuild of the blizzard taxiframe just to handle this issue...


2005-10-22  Version 1.2.7-beta2
-------------------------------
- BETA release
- Modify flight node display code.  If show alt paths are enabled the remote flight master display shows the nodes the current character knows as yellow, grey for nodes not known.
- WorldMap update routine modified to correct bug where the update routine might be called before the loading of data.


2005-10-21  Version 1.2.7-beta
------------------------------
- BETA release
- Add non-flight master flight map display.  To view, use /efm open.  This acts like the flightmaster map with all nodes showing grey.  The same config as the normal flight master display applies, so if you have disabled remote flight nodes known by alts, then you won't see them on this map.


2005-10-18  Version 1.2.6
-------------------------
- Add slash command to remove a single flight node.  This should cover for the times when blizzard renames a flight node, just delete the old entry by it's name and then you will no longer have that data cluttering your display.
- Add keybinding for options screen.


2005-10-14  Version 1.2.5
--------------------------
- Patch 1.8 updates
- Alliance data for enUS submitted by jgleigh from curse-gaming.com.
- Horde data for silithus flight path updated.
- Remove unneeded section from xml file.


2005-09-27  Version 1.2.4b
--------------------------
- Correct LYS_LOADED library issue


2005-09-27  Version 1.2.4
-------------------------
- Update base library code.  The new library code should resolve the issue with the latest release of myAddOns, and also allow the options screen to be available once more.
- Include French flight-data supplied by Corwin.  At this time not all flight paths are in the default load for french, nor do all paths have times/costs, this will be corrected as I have time.
- Correct slashcommand issue.  Only one of the two slash commands was active.
- Cleanup of localization files.  All translators who have assisted with this, the new format should make translations easier, please look over this and re-do any translations that are wrong.
- Remove loading message enable/disable.  This feature is now handled in the library code.


2005-09-17  Version 1.2.3
-------------------------
- Update french translations
- Move translations off to seperate files for each locale.  enUS is the "default" locale as that is the locale I code with.
- Move localizations off to their own segments in the toc, this moves all static definitions out of the xml file.


2005-09-16  Version 1.2.2
-------------------------
- Modified taxiframe handling to operate via event handler and not hook the event function.
- Changed the logic behind the function that adds flight node information.
- Generate max POI numbers on the fly.  This allows for just updating the xml, or for blizzard to modify the max POI's in the main taxiframe xml.
- Using some blizzard defined strings for output rather than my own.  This allows for easier translation efforts.
- Modify known paths code to not require initialising.
- Cleanup of the FlightMapData.lua file.  Data will need to be erased on the client-side to cover for the update.
- Modification of init functions to be more localised for the various program segments.


2005-09-14  Version 1.2.1
-------------------------
- Correct issue with unknown flight times and the new remote flight timer code (Error in timer.lua).
- Correct issue where a route might be known, but not the flight time.  This removes unknown flight routes from the remote flight path code until the user learns the route.


2005-09-12  Version 1.2
-----------------------
- When a flight node is "reachable" add to known flightpaths... this might break things, I haven't tested this extensively.
- Position change of the in-flight timer to not obscure the zone name displays.
- Initial test setup for allowing for size change of the in-flight progress bar.
- Add option to display remote flight path times and costs.  Also display the path needed to fly there for that cost and time.
- Add size toggle for in-flight status bar large or a smaller bar.
- Update toc to 1700.


2005-09-09  Version 1.1
-------------------------
- Minor update to Localisations.
- Add myAddons to the optional dependancy list, just in case it was not loading after it, or the details where not working for it.
- Add status bar for in-flight timer, can be toggled off and on from the config menu.
- Modify zone map routine to write only when the zone map is opened, this should reduce the amount of processing the addon does.
- Random code-cleanup.
- Set load message to being active/not active by a variable... will add config option to modify variable in later releases.
- Translations cleanup - removed large chunks of the help message now the GUI config screen is here.


2005-09-05  Version 1.0
-----------------------
- Add in the missing data for Chillwind Camp and Light's Hope Chapel for the map translation data.
- Add in the GUI options screen.  Access via /efm config.
- Add per-character flight map display.
- Split flightmaster display functions off to FlightMaster.lua to finalise segmentation effort for program.
- French and German translations lacking at this time.  Hopefully the data can be brought up to date before the next release.


2005-09-05  Version 0.9.8
-------------------------
- Data definitions now locale-specific.  Until naming data and the EFM_MapTranslation data are provided to me, those on locales other than enUS will not be able to load any base data.
- Update zone map tooltip so the timers align under each other (approximately, the proportional font makes that a touch difficult).
- Alliance data for Kalimdor on enUS completed.
- Horde data for Azeroth on enUS completed.
- Horde data for Kalimdor on enUS completed.
- Alliance data for Azeroth on enUS completed.
- Alliance data for Kalimdor on enUS completed.
- Druid data on enUS completed.
- Add MapNotes to optional dependancy to attempt to force EFM to load after MapNotes so the worldmapbutton_onupdate routine is not overwritten.
- Added option to force data clearing on load.  This is to allow me to correct for bad data in the base data store.
- Corrected Data handling routine definition issue.


2005-09-04  Version 0.9.7
-------------------------
- German translation updated by Elkano at curse-gaming.
- Additional data for US horde data set.
- Discovered issue with duration and cost not aligning correctly.  Blizzard uses a proportional font for the tooltip text, so alignment of multiple lines of differents chars is difficult.  Text alignment is now as close as can be done without modifying the tooltip font.
- Modified layer alignment for the zone marker buttons.  This appears to have resolved the mapnotes gathering issue.
- Moved the data handling routines (clearing/loading/validating/definining) off to a seperate file for tracking ease.


2005-09-01  Version 0.9.6
-------------------------
- Correct init routine to call "define" for options, not defaults.
- Hide timer display if disabled in flight.
- Corrected german slash commands (maybe...), replaced uppercase characters with lowercase characters.
- Move to newer library standard.
- Correct issue with ui reload causing zone marker to disappear.


2005-08-31  Version 0.9.5
-------------------------
- Configuration variables are now saved between sessions.  Variables are global, not per-character.
- Add option to hide the druid flight paths if not desired to be shown.


2005-08-30  Version 0.9.4
-------------------------
- Correct Data loading issue.
- Add option to enable/disable flight master positions on zone map.
- Add option to enable/disable in-flight timers.
- Moved options handling to a seperate lua file.
- Convert colour codes in help to use the library defined codes.


2005-08-28  Version 0.9.3

- Added recording of flight costs.
- Added recording of flight master positions.
- Added zone to flight master translations (Yellow = Known by player, Grey = not known by player. Addon collect this data after install, so you need to visit for it to show yellow). 
- Added display of the flight master location to the map screen.
- Added some french translation data, thanks to corwin from curse-gaming.

2005-08-22  Version 0.8
-----------------------

- Update alliance flight paths with additional data, thanks to those that supplied the additional data.


2005-08-11  Version 0.7
-----------------------
- Correct line drawing when the line was less than a pixel wide, this was evident from the splintertree to crossroads flightpath and others.
- Increase number of possible flightpath lines to 100, this should never need to get changed as the maximum number I have seen so far is 28.
- Correct data loading issue for horde/alliance/druid flightpath data.


2005-07-29  Version 0.6
-----------------------
- Code cleanup

- Data loading from the provided data is a merge process (thanks Iriel).


2005-06-27  Version 0.1
-----------------------
